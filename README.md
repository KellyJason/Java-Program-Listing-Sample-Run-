# Java-Program-Listing-Sample-Run-
Developed a Java program to implement a solution of the problem provided by the professor in my CIS 2110 class at MSU Denver

CIS 2110 Project #2
Java Program Listing & Sample Run 

Problem Description: 
Develop a Java program to implement the solution of the problem described in Project 1. In addition to the requirements described in Project #1, your Java program should also:
1.	include a comment at the beginning of the source code that indicates your name as the author and the date it was written.
2.	have the first output to the screen be an appropriate assignment title and your name.
3.	have a minimum of five methods in the second (non-driver) class. The appMain methods does count towards the minimum. Use the pseudocode solution as a guide if you are having trouble meeting the minimum.
4.	PRIORITY SHOULD BE GIVEN to giving me java code that ACTUALLY RUNS.  Get the most basic code you can to run, then stub in println’s to tell me the rest of what you wanted to do.  
5.	I am providing you with pseudocode AND “stub code”, which is the start of a java program for this project.  If you want to use my stub code, you just need to bring my code into your development environment (I suggest NetBeans from Oracle OR jGrasp) and then make changes to the code I provide in order to make the code complete the task. 
6.	If you want to use your pseudocode and write the JAVA from scratch, that’s great- you are NOT required to use my pseudocode or my JAVA.
